# BorneanBirds

## Step 1: Building a universal bird model.
To do this, pull bird recordings from xeno-canto, an archive of recordings from amateur/hobbysit birders.
Xeno-canto uploaders also tag their sounds with the region from which it was pulled,  so we can sort it and pull recordings only from the region of interest to us - Indonesian Borneo.

Use this as labelled data to build a unversal bird model.
1. Perform spectral subtration & remove mean frequencies - this will liekly get rid of insect / wind etc noises that are common across recordings.
